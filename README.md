# deconz-xbee-plugin

This repository contains the old XBee plugin for deCONZ by dresden elektronik, which no longer is maintained.  I'm trying to get it compiled for deCONZ v2.05.35 and later for educational purposes and to see what functionality could be incorparated in the [REST API plugin](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin).

See https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/643 for some background info.
